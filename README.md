# German_town-a
Simple python script that plots all the german towns/villages/cities/hamlets that end with the letter "a".

The final result is the following image:

It clearly can be seen that there is a higher concentration in the central regions (which correspond roughly to Th√ºringen and Sachsen). <b>But why?</b> (Feel free to use the issue section to answer/discuss)
